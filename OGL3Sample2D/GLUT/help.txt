The game consists of all the mouse controls and keyboard controls as mentioned in the problem statement.

Ways to achieve score:
1) Shoot black bricks
2) Collect red bricks in red bucket
3) Collect blue bricks in blue bucket

However, misfiring at red/blue bricks will deduct your score (can be negative).

Ways to lose game:
1) Collecting black bricks in any bucket
2) When lives become 0 due to misfiring at red and blue bricks

In addition to the standard red,blue and black bricks, there is an additional green brick which acts as another falling object that deflects the laser (multiple deflections possible off green bricks)

Score board is a running one in the terminal along with the number of lives.
